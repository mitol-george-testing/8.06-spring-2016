Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _8.06 Quantum Physics III_ as it was taught by Professor Aram Harrow in Spring 2016.

This course is a continuation of _[8.05 Quantum Physics II](/courses/8-422-atomic-and-optical-physics-ii-spring-2013/)__._ Topics include units, time-independent approximation methods, the structure of one- and two-electron atoms, charged particles in a magnetic field and time-dependent perturbation theory. Students research and write a paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 and 8.06.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Interpret and analyze a wide range of quantum mechanical systems using both exact analytic techniques and various approximation methods.
*   Gain an introduction to important model systems studied in contemporary physics, including white dwarf stars, two dimensional electron systems, the fine structure of Hydrogen, lasers, and particle scattering.
